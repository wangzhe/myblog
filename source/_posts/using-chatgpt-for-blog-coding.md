Recently I started using ChatGPT to help me code this blog. It's fascinating to see how AI can assist in generating snippets, debugging, and even writing posts like this one.

I plan to share my experience as I continue exploring how this tool can speed up development and content creation.

Aug-18, 2025 cloudy day.
Eventually, I upload my blog to git site. It takes time. Here I'd like to log my process

1. merge all related PR in myblog.git
2. pull to local
3. hexo g and hexo d, but here my problem that it is still not work.
4. remove all code locally
5. re-git clone and hexo g and hexo d again
6. works.

According to the Sonnet, the reason may be from cache. The "hexo clean" may need first.
